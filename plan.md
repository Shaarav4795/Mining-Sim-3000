**5\. Unedited GDD which has every info:**

Idle Miner Tycoon merged with some RPG elements

We have a start page with a **Start** button and a **Credits** button.

Once you click the **Start** button and it is your first time playing the game, a tutorial appears. You have a mining operation set up, and the aim of the game is to defeat the competing mining operation. This will be achieved through discovering new mines underground (the RPG element). The RPG element is an avatar controlled by arrow keys, used to discover new shafts/caves by mining, fight the goblins that frequent the mines, and access the shop, etc., via a quick platformer.

Once you discover a new mine, you can spend some in‑game money to open it and play a minigame, then buy a worker to mine that specific mine. The worker is autonomous and can be upgraded to a maximum level of 5, which increases their output.

**MAP** – Central map with all the entrances to shafts and shops. Shafts are separate rooms (first‑time‑play minigame) and workers move in and out of them. Entrances start as generic dirt blocks that turn into wooden entrances when discovered, and a popup asks you to pay money (or not) to open them. Open mines are red‑shaded squares.

**ORES** – You can discover them in any order, but each has a different cost depending on the maximum output it can produce.

| Ore | Purchase cost for mine | Max output per hour |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Uranium | $120 | $500 /hr |
| Coal | $15 | $300 /hr |
| Diamond | $80 | $350 /hr |
| Gold | $50 | $400 /hr |
| Opal | $30 | $250 /hr |

**How to win** – Using the shop, you buy weapons throughout the game (this is encouraged in the tutorial) to defeat the “final boss” (the competing mining company). Once you decide you have enough weapons, you can fight the boss by clicking a button, which starts a quick‑level minigame. The final boss fight has you using your weapons against an AI boss with HP, etc., and should take 1–1.5 minutes to fully beat.

**Mining** – By pressing arrow keys next to a block, you can mine that block. Upgrading your pickaxe is done in the shop.

**Shop items & upgrades**

- **Weapons**: Knife (starter weapon; the tutorial explains when, how, and why to use it), RPG, pistol, grenade (to kill the boss and fend off goblins)  
- **Pickaxe**: Silver, Gold, Diamond (each improves mining speed)  
- **Worker** (assigned to each specific mine room, not the main shaft)  
- **Worker upgrades** (also specific to each mine room)
